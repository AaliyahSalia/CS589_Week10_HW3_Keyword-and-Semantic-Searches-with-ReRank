**Dense Retrieval**

Dense vectors:
In dense retrieval, documents and queries are represented as dense vectors in a high-dimensional vector space.
Each dimension of the vector carries information about different aspects of the text.

Semantic information:
Dense vectors capture rich semantic information about the text, allowing for more nuanced understanding of document-query relevance.

Embeddings:
Dense retrieval often involves using word embeddings or document embeddings, such as Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, or more advanced models like BERT, to represent text as dense vectors.

**Sparse Retrieval**

Sparse representations:
In contrast, sparse retrieval relies on sparse representations, typically using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or bag-of-words models.

Keyword-based:
Sparse retrieval is often keyword-based, where documents and queries are represented as sets of keywords or terms.

Limited semantics:
Sparse representations lack the rich semantic information that dense vectors provide.
They focus on the presence or absence of specific terms.
